         <h2>Races</h2> 
	 <p>To begin bulding your character, choose their race.  The races are divided
            by continent of origin, so be sure you know where the area of play is.
            Each race will contain the stats for that race, a list of subraces if 
            applicable, and some information on the lore of the race with links to 
            further reading.</p>

         <h2>Classes</h2>
	 <p>The next step in creating your character is to choose a class.  You can think of 
            your class as a combination of your character's skill set and place in the world.
            Its an expression of how your character interacts with the world around them as 
            an adventurer.<br><br>  
            Each class has a series of sublcasses that change or add to the main class in 
            different ways.  You will choose one subclass at the appropriate level.  Be 
            sure to refer to the class table in each class main page to see what your 
            character gains each level.</p>
