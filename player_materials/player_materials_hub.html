         <h2>Races</h2> 
	 <p>To begin bulding your character, choose their race.  The races are divided
            by continent of origin, so be sure you know where the area of play is.
            Each race will contain the stats for that race, a list of subraces if 
            applicable, and some information on the lore of the race with links to 
            further reading.</p>

         <h2>Classes</h2>
	 <p>The next step in creating your character is to choose a class.  You can think of 
            your class as a combination of your character's skill set and place in the world.
            Its an expression of how your character interacts with the world around them as 
            an adventurer.<br><br>  
            Each class has a series of sublcasses that change or add to the main class in 
            different ways.  You will choose one subclass at the appropriate level.  Be 
            sure to refer to the class table in each class main page to see what your 
            character gains each level.</p>

         <h2>History</h2>
         <p>A character's history is made up of their background and backstory.  Your 
            character's background depicts the kind of life your character lived before they
            got to the point where the campaign begins.  This life is not necessarily in
            the character's past and may still effect them throughout the campaign, or not.
            <br><br>          
            Their backstory is essentially their lifestory, written by you.  It may be long 
            or short, limited only by your imagination, though I ask you keep a maximum of 5
            pages in mind.</p>

         <p>Feats are essentially special abilities That can enhance your character's combat
            ability, give you access to skills you wouldn't otherwise be able to get, 
            or simply add additional flavor your character.  You start with one at Level 1, 
            and you can gain more whenever you would get an Ability Score Improvement.  You
            take either the Ability Score Improvement or the Feat.</p>

         <h2>Equipment</h2>
         <p>The equipment your character carries can be bought here.  Currency is organized
            in a 4-tier system: copper being the least valuable, silver converts to 10 
            copper pieces, gold converts to 10 silver pieces, and platinum converts to 
            10 gold pieces.  You start with 70 gold pieces plus any additional money you 
            gain from your background.  You can spend this money on your starting equipment 
            found below.</p>

         <h2>Spells</h2>
         <p>Magic is esoteric and rare in the world of Ouroboros.  If you are playing as a 
            class that uses magic, you may face exaltation or persecution depending on where
            you are or who you encounter.  It is commonly said that magic flows from the soul
            through pathways in the blood and is shaped by the mind.  There is generally an
            inheritable element to magic ability though this can be circumvented with 
            dangerous augmentations or the aid of a supernatural being.  Generally, magic
            is split into three categories: Arcane magic represent traditional casting and 
            draws upon the power of the soul, Divine magic represents gifts from the gods to
            their most devout followers, and Eldritch magic comes from more ineffable and 
            obscure sources.</p>
