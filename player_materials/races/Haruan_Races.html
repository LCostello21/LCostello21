            <p>Haru is a culturally diverse continent with many different tribes forming
               before the Age of Horizons on the many islands of the continent.  With the 
               invention of boats to sail the seas and kites to soar amongst the clouds, 
               through war, strife, piety, trade, and circumstance three great nations have 
               emerged: The Eternal Dynasty on the Island of Zhen, the Ashen Shogunate on the
               island of Haishima, and the Free Cities on the island of Gyano.  Each species
               is categorized under the Nation they originate from, though due to the 
               expansion and accessabilitty of transportation your character need not have
               been born or have lived within that nation.  In addition to choosing your
               species, you may also choose an origin.</p>
