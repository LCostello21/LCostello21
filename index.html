            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>Ouroboros is a high-fantasy world of mystery, wonder, the struggles of human 
               nature, and cosmic horror.  Nations will rise and fall in the shadows of bickering
               gods, and the advancement of science and magic will unveil new and disturbing 
               questions on the nature of the universe.</p>
            <blockquote>
            "As I touched the silvery, glowing stone my mind began to expand beyond the 
             confines of my body.  I could feel the life pulse of other creatures around me,
             their hearts beating, their hunger, their dreams.  My initial fascination 
             shriveled to dread as the expansion of my conscience continued, and I began to 
             become...aware...of a connection within the life around me, a being, or
             perhaps a pattern my straining mind could only begin to comprehend.  I'm lucky I
             managed to pull away, else I fear I'd have seen too much and been lost."
             - notes from the journal of Bruklad Silverfingers, 302 ED

            <h2>Making a Character</h2>
            <p>The Player Materials page has all you will need to make a character.  However,
               knowing the lore of the part of the world you will be playing in will greatly
               aid both you the player and your DM when creating your backstory and 
               integrating your character into the world.  You don't have to know everything,
               just enough to understand your position in the world.  The information in the 
               Lore section is presented as "common knowledge," basically what a regular person 
               might know on the topic.  Advanced information is located in the DM Materials 
               page and is to be read at your DM's discretion.</p>
